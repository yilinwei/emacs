* Emacs

This is an experimental setup for mixing *Nix* with *Emacs*. It does not depend
on *NixOS*, but rather uses the ~site-lisp~ mechanism to bootstrap the configuration.
This is because my typical usage means that I don't much around with the configuration
once it has been setup.

* Quickstart

The ~site-init.el~ and ~site-packages.el~ are bootstrap mechanisms because the emacs
created by nix looks for anything under ~share/site/elisp~ in ~NIX_PROFILES~. We
make use of that fact to have a minimal ~init.el~.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

;; -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

(setq gc-cons-threshold (* 50 1000 1000))
(require 'site-packages)
(evil-mode)
(setq gc-cons-threshold (* 2 1000 1000))

#+END_SRC

* Addendum

** Fonts

Fonts cause problems because they need to be installed under specific directories
if we are not using NixOS. Font config looks under ~$HOME/.local/share/fonts~ for
any fonts we might want.

This is slightly unfortunate, but we can still bundle the fonts that we want
available using Nix by creating symlinks between the nix store font and the font that
we care about.

** Direnv

** Global vs. local
** Notes

 - Always use direnv mode for per project command line tools (compilers, build tools,
   etc...). Most frustrating are tools like ~agda.el~
