* Emacs

This is an experimental setup for mixing *Nix* with *Emacs*. It does not depend
on *NixOS*, but rather uses the ~site-lisp~ mechanism to bootstrap the configuration.
This is because my typical usage means that I don't much around with the configuration
once it has been setup.

** Quickstart

The ~site-init.el~ and ~site-packages.el~ are bootstrap mechanisms because the emacs
created by nix looks for anything under ~share/site/elisp~ in ~NIX_PROFILES~. We
make use of that fact to have a minimal ~init.el~.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

;; -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

(require 'site-packages)
(require 'site-init)

#+END_SRC

** Global vs. local
** Notes

 - Always use direnv mode for per project command line tools (compilers, build tools,
   etc...). Most frustrating are tools like ~agda.el~
